# Java-Login-Authentication-Project

This is a Java Swing GUI project I will be adding to overtime to demonstrate GUI usage and credential authentication.

Boilerplate Swing GUI code originally from [Alex Lee's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE8tZ0hn2Ws&t=85s&ab_channel=AlexLee) going over [Princeton's Swing GUI example](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout/GUI.java.html)
 
## To be implemented going forward
- upgrading to and connecting Spring application to a MongoDB database that stores given login credentials
- improving security with the addition of proper authentication / security add ons such as OAuth2 and other security tools from Spring
- possibly transferring GUI to a seperate front-end application
- may be used as a boilerplate application for future projects
